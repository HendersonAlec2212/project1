# project1
First project - SMU Data Analysis - DataViz
 - see 5.2_act04 - tips on bar charts
 - see 5.3_act09 - multi figure graph


# Intro

The purpose of this project, how it was done. what is the story we wish to tell

# Data Set 
<hyperlink_to_file?>

what was the data set we ended with
advantages and limitations of the data set (only having a smaple of the type of cars available, inconsistent pricing, lack of data on individuals who bought a car and used it until it died 300K mileage?)
where there any outliers?

# Method

How did we end up with the data we used? what were some challenges(maybe save challenges for conclusion) 
what did we do with the data, how did we use it? 
example: GRAPHING
"This was done by passing columns of the Clean_DataFrame through functions [ .groupby() &/or .value_counts() ] this allowed us to group the data as desire for comparison and pull values for storing as numbers or strings to make easy x/y labels to match graphs."

The next plan of action was to move data through different graphs as a means of displaying the data to observe certain correlations between THIS and THAT variable noting which proved most promising based on teh .corr() function passed over the Data Frame..

How did we produce the visualizations, why did we choose the graphs we chose
Scatter, Line, Pie, Bar, Etc [https://datavizcatalogue.com/search.html]

# Analysis - the meat of the readme

what did we observe
what are the notable trends
which vehicle/model/make/ was best

what has the story of the vehicles told us so far


I observed a trend in this graph and that graph of a make/model vs average of all cars to show
1. A strong/med/weak positive/negative correlation in so and so.
2. more data comparison perhaps vs a runner-up

This leads me to think that there is a relationship between the this and that attribute that contributes to this car or this make/model being the best for overall longevity

talk about how the data could look in other graphs? maybe drop in a multi figure graph to show attributes vs a similar X like we did in the crime excercise

any outliers explained in further detail

do we have or need a control? we could make some general oberservatin against the average of all cars

# Conclusion

Grouping the right information to tell the story of the data may be a challenge in some parts of the assignment. 

the key is to break down the challenge in to separate chunks and accomplish those chunks
